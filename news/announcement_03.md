Our paper on [modelling polyelectrolyte gels that undergo phase separation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmps.2021.104771)
has been accepted for publication in JMPS.  We show that a novel mode of phase
separation can lead to localised pattern formation and a breakdown of
electroneutrality in the bulk of the gel.
