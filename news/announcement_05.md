Oliver's paper on [fluid-fluid phase separation in soft granular materials](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmps.2022.104892)
has been accepted in JMPS.
We derive a thermodynamically consistent model to capture the formation of
cavities within the granular material when one fluid phase is strongly
non-wetting.
