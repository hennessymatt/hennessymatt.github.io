    "text": "Mechanics of hydrogels\n\n\n\n\n\nHydrogels are soft, porous solids that are extremely water absorbent. Some hydrogels are able to absorb more than 1000 times their dry mass of water! Moreover, many hydrogels are responsive to their environment. This means that stimuli such as temperature, electricity, and magnetism can be used to alter how much water they absorb and hence control their shape. The behaviour of hydrogels is governed by a delicate interplay of fluid and solid mechanics and thermodynamics, making them particularly interesting to study. Our research on hydrogels involves:\n\nMulti-scale and microstructural modelling of hydrogels\nModelling of thermo-, electro-, and magneto-responsive hydrogels\nPhase separation and phase transitions in hydrogels\nHow hydrogels interact with external fluids\nBiomedical applications of hydrogels (artificial cartilage, drug delivery)\n\n\n\n\nComplex fluids\n\n\n\n\n\nFluids that appear in industrial and biological contexts are usually not simple liquids. Instead, these fluids often have a liquid and solid component. The solid component could be grains in the case of coffee or cells in the case of blood. The physical properties of the fluid can be strongly impacted by the solid component, as anyone who has added cornstarch to water knows. Fluids with a solid component are usually called complex fluids, owning to their complex mechanical behaviours. Our research into complex fluids has focused on:\n\nFracture and delamination of evaporating colloidal suspensions\nGelation of complex fluids\nPhase separation in polymer solutions and biological fluids\nViscoelasticity and poroelasticity\nPattern formation in granular fluids\n\n\n\n\nLight-driven 3D printing\n\n\n\n\n\n3D printing has led to a manufacturing revolution by enabling complex objects to be rapidly and inexpensively produced. At the CFM lab, we develop models that can guide light-driven 3D printing. A main challenge is that the models must be simple enough to use in practice but still capture the key physics. Specific topics of interest are:\n\nDeriving minimal models that capture mass transport, optical attenuation, and thermal effects\nUnderstanding the fluid and solid mechanics of 3D printing\nUsing machine learning to simulate and optimise 3D printing\nModelling dual- and multi-wavelength 3D printing\n\n\n\n\nLithium-ion batteries\n\n\n\n\n\nLithium-ion batteries power many devices such as mobile phones and laptops. Despite the advantages of lithium-ion batteries, they can overheat and degrade over time. At the CFM lab, our research on batteries focuses on:\n\nUsing asymptotic methods to derive simplified models of batteries\nDetection of internal short circuits using machine learning\nModelling nanowire-based electrodes"

    "section": "Multi-scale modelling of polyelectrolyte gels",
    "text": "Multi-scale modelling of polyelectrolyte gels\nEPSRC New Investigator Award, UKRI093, Jan 2025–Dec 2027\nPolyelectrolyte (PE) gels are soft, fluid-filled solids that can change their size and shape in response to their environment. The ability to control the response of a PE gel can lead to new technologies for artificial muscles, soft robotics, drug delivery, water purification, and energy storage. However, the physics that provide PE gels with their responsiveness take place across multiple length scales, ranging from nanometres to centimetres. Despite extensive modelling and experimental studies, it is still unclear how these physics manifest in the bulk response of the gel. As a result, it is very difficult to design a PE gel so that it undergoes the right response for a given application.\nThe aim of this research is to harness the power of multi-scale mathematical methods to derive a new model of a PE gel based on continuum mechanics. The model will explicitly capture the multiple length scales where the physics that underpin gel responsiveness take place. By seeking exact and numerical solutions to the model, key behaviours of PE gels will be predicted, such as their degree of swelling, when their volume phase transition occurs, and how much they bend when placed in an electric field. Experiments will be carried out to produce data for model validation and refinement. To help investigate and predict stimuli-driven bending of PE gels, asymptotic methods will be used to develop simplified mathematical models for gels with thin geometries (e.g. gel plates, beams, and sheets).\nThis project will unlock the technological potential of PE gels by revealing how their environmental response can be tuned through their underlying physics. In addition, the new, experimentally validated models can be used as tools to inform the design of PE gels and optimise their use in a wide range of transformative technologies. For example, tuning how PE gels deswell can improve their ability to function as intelligent drug-delivery vehicles that release the right amount of drugs at the right place in the body."

There are opportunities to carry out experimental work as well.\nWe currently have PhD projects relating to:\n\nEvaporation of particle-laden fluids\nMulti-scale modelling of polymer gels using machine learning\nOptimisation of hydrogel-based drug delivery systems\nShrinkage and swelling during 3D printing\nElectro- and magneto-active hydrogels\n\nCompetitive funding is available for PhD projects. Details of PhD studentships are usually announced around December. Application deadlines are typically at the end of January. If you are interested in joining the group as a PhD student, you are strongly advised to get in touch in November or December.\nInformation about admission requirements for a PhD in Engineering Mathematics can be found here."
