**Matt Hennessy** leads the CFM Lab. His research interests lie at the interface
of applied maths, materials science and engineering, and soft matter. He is a Senior Lecturer in Engineering Mathematics at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/).  Matt is a co-lead of the [SUM4Products network](https://sum4products.co.uk) and the [UK Hydrogels Network](https://sites.google.com/view/ukhydrogels/home).
Matt is passionate about using maths to solve real-world problems arising in industry, and he is 
a Knowledge Exchange Champion for the [UK Knowledge Exchange Hub for Mathematical Sciences](https://www.kehubmaths.co.uk/).

Matt obtained a BSc in Physics and Applied Mathematics from [Ontario Tech University](https://ontariotechu.ca).  He then completed an [MSc in 
Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/study-here/postgraduate-study/msc-courses/msc-mathematical-modelling-and-scientific-computing) and a DPhil in 
Applied Mathematics at the 
[University of Oxford](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk).  He then held a 
post-doc position in 
the [Department of Chemical Engineering at Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/chemical-engineering), followed by a 
[Marie Curie-Sk≈Çodowska Fellowship](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships) at the [Centre de Recerca Matematica](http://www.crm.cat) in Barcelona, and then returned to Oxford to take
up a [Hooke Research Fellowship](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/research-fellowship-programmes/hooke-and-titchmarsh-fellowships).  Matt joined Bristol in 2021.
