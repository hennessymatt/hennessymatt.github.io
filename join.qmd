 to discuss further.

## PhD projects

We are looking for talented and enthusiastic students to work on PhD projects.
Applicants should have a keen interest in fluid and solid mechanics, numerical
simulations, and using mathematical techniques to solve real-world problems.
There may be opportunities to carry out experimental work as well.

We currently have PhD projects relating to:

* Evaporation of particle-laden fluids
* Multi-scale modelling of polymer gels using machine learning
* Optimisation of hydrogel-based drug delivery systems
* Shrinkage and swelling during 3D printing
* Electro- and magneto-active hydrogels


Competitive funding is available for PhD projects. Application deadlines are typically at the end of January.  If you are interested in applying for a PhD position, you are strongly advised to get in touch **before January**.
[Information about admission requirements can be found here](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/research/engineering-mathematics).  


## Post-doc opportunties

<!-- The CFM Lab does not currently have funding for post-doctoral researchers.  Please check again as vacancies will be posted here. -->

We are looking to recruit a post-doctoral researcher to work on modelling and simulation of electrically charged polymer gels (polyelectrolyte gels).  The deadline to apply is
**6 May 2025**.  More information about the position can be
found on the [University of Bristol's website](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/jobs/find/details/?jobId=374862&jobTitle=Research%20Associate%2FSenior%20Research%20Associate%20in%20Multi-scale%20Modelling%20of%20Polymer%20Gels).
